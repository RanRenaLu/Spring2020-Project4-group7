+ Project summary: In this project, we implemented algorithm A2 (Gradient Descent with Probabilistic Assumption), A3 (Alternativa Least Square) and postprocessed with P2 (KNN), and applied cross validation to tune the parameters in A2 and A3. Finally, by combining A2 + P2 and A3 + P2, we further improved the performance on test dataset in terms of the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
